Create a new folder called 'hw6' and copy over the content from hw5. 
You MUST remove the table used as your main page layout and replace it with 
appropriate CSS. You may download bootstrap and use it or any themes based on 
it for your layout. Your pages must maintain the same data and menus from hw5, 
just use CSS for layout and design. You may keep any tables you use within your 
page to display other data. Turn in the url to your homework on Blackboard.
